# A KiCad design for TPS63070

The purpose is for building a PCB to test a battery voltage feed for a 5V
circuit with minimum ripple voltage because MCU needs to know the battery
percentage also should be high efficient to use full battery power.

As I researched the inductor is very important in this design to it's DCR how
much it's less the boost converter would be efficient.
